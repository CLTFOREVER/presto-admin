Upgrading Presto-Admin
======================

Upgrading to a newer version of ``presto-admin`` requires deleting the old
installation and then installing the new version.  After you've deleted the
``prestoadmin`` directory, install the newer version of ``presto-admin``
by following the instructions in the installation section
(see :ref:`presto-admin-installation-label`). Your configuration files
located in ``~/.prestoadmin`` will remain intact and continue to be used
by the newer version of ``presto-admin``.
